# Dependency Inversion Principle

The DIP covers two important things:

- A high-level concrete class should not depend on low-level
- Abstractions should not depend upon details, Instead the details should upon abstraction.

> you should use abstract classes or interfaces. As a result, you remove the tight coupling between the classes.
